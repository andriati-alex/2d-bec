# ALEX V. ANDRIATI BENCHMARK OF 2D GROSS-PITAEVSKII EQUATION
# 
# Here are some values resulting from the imaginary time propagation to
# find the ground state of a 2D confined BEC. Before explain each column
# the commun parameters are:
#
#   I. Isotropic harmonic confinement (x^2 + y^2)/2
#  II. No rotation applied
# III. Dimensionless units the factor multiplying the derivatives is 1/2
#
# The results explored here are obtained using a function normalized  to 1
# To compute the residue, given the Hamiltonian and the solution '\Psi' we
# compute | \mu*\Psi - H(\Psi) | at each gird point.  Then  we display the
# maximum over the grid points and the integration.
# The columns indicate the following quantities:
#
#   1. time step
#   2. spatial domain boundary 1
#   3. spatial domain boundary 2
#   4. number of grid points in each direction
#   5. interaction strength (factor that multiply the non-linearity)
#   6. Energy
#   7. chemical potential
#   8. average radius
#   9. Maximun Residue on the grid
#  10. Integrated absolute value of residue over the grid
